    # The reason for this approach rather than using the build number
    # is to allow for jobs from different builds. In one build job the
    # job number might be at 1200, whilst in a release job the number
    # may be only 1. This approach assums that if you install a build
    # with a different semantic version then the highest is the
    # desired one, but if you install two with the same semver then
    # the newest is the desired version.

    # Build up a score. It needs to fit in 32 bits

    altscore=$((altscore * 14 + @VERSION_MINOR@)) # Allow up to 14 minor

    # So far if the version is less than 9 we have a number (altscore)
    # that is less than 1175.  2**31/1175 is about 1.8 million. So
    # multiply altscore by 1,000,000 and add in a factor of how many
    # minutes have passed from an arbitary point in time (1,600,000,000
    # seconds after 1 Jan 1970 or Sep 13 12:26:40 2020) on the
    # basis that no one is going to be installing a new version more
    # often than every minute. This does get things wrong if a million
    # minutes pass and you are downgrading, but the chances of someone
    # waiting almost 2 years between installing a version and the
    # previous patch level is small.
